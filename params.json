After taking this tutorial you will learn about how to communicate to Arduino microcontroller over a local wifi network and then through internet.  \r\n\r\n### Arduino\r\n\r\nArduino is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Learn more about Arduino from [arduino.cc](http://arduino.cc)\r\n\r\n### ESP8266\r\n\r\nThe ESP8266 WiFi Module is a self contained SOC with integrated TCP/IP protocol stack that can give any microcontroller access to your WiFi network. The ESP8266 is capable of either hosting an application or offloading all Wi-Fi networking functions from another application processor. Each ESP8266 module comes pre-programmed with an AT command set firmware, meaning, you can simply hook this up to your Arduino device and get about as much WiFi-ability as a WiFi Shield offers (and that’s just out of the box)! The ESP8266 module is an extremely cost effective board with a huge, and ever growing, community.    \r\nTo get started with ESP8266 refer the [Getting started doc](http://www.esp8266.com/wiki/doku.php?id=getting-started-with-the-esp8266)  \r\nThe technical specifications of the ESP8266 shall be referred from the from [the official specification document](http://www.esp8266.com/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=esp8266_specifications_english.pdf)  \r\n\r\n### Communications to ESP8266\r\nAT commands over serial communication are used to communicate with the ESP8266. You can refer the complete command set from [the instruction set reference](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/4/0/3/4A-ESP8266__AT_Instruction_Set__EN_v0.30.pdf)\r\n\r\nBasic AT commands we use in this tutorial are,\r\n\r\n**AT+RST**  \r\nUsed to reset the ESP8266, clearing RAM.\r\n\r\n**ATE0**  \r\nUsed to disable echo of last entered command.\r\n\r\n**AT+CWMODE=\\<mode\\>**   \r\nUsed to enable/disable client and AP mode of ESP8266.  \r\n\\<mode\\> values are,  \r\n1 : station mode  \r\n2 : softAP mode  \r\n3 : softAP + station mode  \r\n\r\n**AT+CIPSERVER=\\<mode\\>,\\<port\\>**   \r\nUsed to initialise a TCP server on ESP8266.   \r\n\\<mode\\> and \\<port\\> values are,    \r\n\\<mode\\> 0 Delete server  \r\n\\<mode\\> 1 Create server  \r\n\\<port\\> port number, default is 333  \r\n\r\n**AT+CIPSTART=\\<link ID\\>,\\<type\\>,\\<remote IP\\>,\\<remote port\\>**  \r\nUsed to Establish TCP connection or UDP transmission.  \r\n\\<link ID\\> ID of network connection (0~4), used for multi-connection  \r\n\\<type\\> string, \"TCP\" or \"UDP\"  \r\n\\<remote IP\\> string, remote IP address  \r\n\\<remote port\\> string, remote port number  \r\n\r\n**AT+CIPSEND=\\<link ID\\>,\\<length\\>**  \r\nUsed to send data\r\n\\<link ID\\> ID of the connection (0~4), for multi-connect  \r\n\\<length\\> data length, MAX 2048 bytes  \r\n\r\n**AT+CWJAP=\\<ssid\\>,\\<pwd\\>**  \r\nUsed to connect to an AP  \r\n\\<ssid\\> string, AP’s SSID  \r\n\\<pwd\\> string, MAX: 64 bytes ASCII  \r\n\r\n**AT+ CIFSR**  \r\nUsed to get local IP address  \r\n\r\n**AT+CWSAP=\\<ssid\\>,\\<pwd\\>,\\<chl\\>,\\<ecn\\>**  \r\nUsed for the configuration of softAP mode  \r\n\\<ssid\\> string, ESP8266 softAP SSID  \r\n\\<pwd\\> string, range: 8 ~ 64 bytes ASCII  \r\n\\<chl\\> channel id  \r\n\\<ecn\\>  \r\n0\tOPEN  \r\n2\tWPA_PSK  \r\n3 \tWPA2_PSK  \r\n4 \tWPA_WPA2_PSK  \r\n\r\n###Interfacing ESP8266 with Arduino  \r\nRefer the [Getting started doc](http://www.esp8266.com/wiki/doku.php?id=getting-started-with-the-esp8266)  \r\n\r\n###Now refer the codes..\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n[IDIoTIC.me](http://idiotic.me) is an open-source IoT platform that provides software as well as hardware developer platform and tools to make the world connected around you.
