After this workshop you will learn about how to communicate to Arduino micro controller over a local wifi network and then through internet.  \r\n\r\n## Arduino\r\n\r\nArduino is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Learn more about Arduino from [arduino.cc](http://arduino.cc)\r\n\r\n## ESP8266\r\n\r\nThe ESP8266 WiFi Module is a self contained SOC with integrated TCP/IP protocol stack that can give any microcontroller access to your WiFi network. The ESP8266 is capable of either hosting an application or offloading all Wi-Fi networking functions from another application processor. Each ESP8266 module comes pre-programmed with an AT command set firmware, meaning, you can simply hook this up to your Arduino device and get about as much WiFi-ability as a WiFi Shield offers (and thatâ€™s just out of the box)! The ESP8266 module is an extremely cost effective board with a huge, and ever growing, community.    \r\n  \r\nTo get started with ESP8266 refer the [Getting started doc](http://www.esp8266.com/wiki/doku.php?id=getting-started-with-the-esp8266)  \r\n  \r\nThe technical specifications of the ESP8266 shall be referred from the from [the official specification document](http://www.esp8266.com/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=esp8266_specifications_english.pdf)  \r\n\r\n## Communications to ESP8266\r\nAT commands over serial communication are used to communicate with the ESP8266. You can refer the complete command set from [the instruction set reference](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/4/0/3/4A-ESP8266__AT_Instruction_Set__EN_v0.30.pdf)\r\n\r\n##Interfacing ESP8266 with Arduino  \r\nRefer the [Getting started doc](http://www.esp8266.com/wiki/doku.php?id=getting-started-with-the-esp8266)  \r\n\r\n##Source code\r\nRefer our github repository to view and download the source codes.  \r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n[IDIoTIC.me](http://idiotic.me) is an open-source IoT platform that provides software as well as hardware developer platform and tools to make the world connected around you.
